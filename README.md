# Alcohol Consumption and Cognitive Decline
Solo Project | SDSU CS 577 – Data Science Principles & Techniques

## Overview

This project investigates how alcohol consumption levels affect cognitive decline, using datasets related to Alzheimer’s and dementia. I conducted exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and built a random forest classifier to predict dementia progression. Results showed a strong correlation between heavy alcohol use and dementia risk, while moderate use had mixed effects. The project highlights my ability to work with real-world healthcare data, apply statistical reasoning, and communicate insights visually and through technical writing.

## Research Question
Does alcohol consumption significantly affect cognitive decline and dementia progression, and if so, how do these effects vary by age and consumption level?

## Approach
**Data Sources:**
- [Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tammydahl/alzheimers-disease-data)
- [MRI and Alzheimer’s Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers)

**Process:**

- Performed EDA to uncover patterns related to age, MMSE scores, and alcohol use
- Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict dementia progression
- Conducted hypothesis testing on alcohol consumption and cognitive outcomes
- Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC

## Key Findings
- Heavy alcohol consumption showed a strong correlation with increased risk of dementia.
- Moderate drinking produced inconsistent results—some findings suggested potential protective effects, particularly in certain age groups.
- Data visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, MMSE boxplots, age distribution plots) helped clarify the influence of alcohol and age on cognitive performance.

## Why It’s In My Portfolio
This project demonstrates:
- Strong communication of data insights through charts, stats, and written interpretation
- Practical experience cleaning, exploring, and modeling real-world datasets
- Ability to evaluate tradeoffs in model performance and hypothesis testing
- Competence in Python-based tools like _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn_
