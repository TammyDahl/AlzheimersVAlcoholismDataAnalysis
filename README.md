# Alcohol Consumption and Cognitive Decline
Data Analysis Project | CS 577 – Data Science Principles and Techniques

## Overview
This project explores alcohol consumption as a risk factor in the progression of Alzheimer’s and dementia. It was completed for my Data Science course at San Diego State University and combines exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning to investigate the relationship between drinking behavior and cognitive health.

This project highlights my ability to work with real-world health data, ask meaningful questions, and build data-driven narratives—all of which translate directly into the kind of analytical thinking required in data analyst and product analyst roles.

## Research Question
Does alcohol consumption significantly affect cognitive decline and dementia progression, and if so, how do these effects vary by age and consumption level?

## Approach
**Data Sources:**
- [Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tammydahl/alzheimers-disease-data)
- [MRI and Alzheimer’s Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers)

**Process:**

- Performed EDA to uncover patterns related to age, MMSE scores, and alcohol use
- Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict dementia progression
- Conducted hypothesis testing on alcohol consumption and cognitive outcomes
- Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC

## Key Findings
- Heavy alcohol consumption showed a strong correlation with increased risk of dementia.
- Moderate drinking produced inconsistent results—some findings suggested potential protective effects, particularly in certain age groups.
- Data visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, MMSE boxplots, age distribution plots) helped clarify the influence of alcohol and age on cognitive performance.

## Why It’s In My Portfolio
This project demonstrates:
- Strong communication of data insights through charts, stats, and written interpretation
- Practical experience cleaning, exploring, and modeling real-world datasets
- Ability to evaluate tradeoffs in model performance and hypothesis testing
- Competence in Python-based tools like _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn_
